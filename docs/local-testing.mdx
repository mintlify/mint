The [Mintlify CLI](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mintlify) lets you preview your documentation in real-time.

You need Node v18 to use the Mintlify CLI.

## User Guide

### Installing

Download the Mintlify <Tooltip tip="Command-line Interface">CLI</Tooltip> using the following command.

```bash Terminal
npm i -g mintlify
```

### Previewing Docs Locally

Run `mintlify dev` inside the docs folder where your `mint.json` file is located. Mintlify will open at `localhost:3000`.

<Tip>

The Mintlify CLI will automatically move to the next port if you were already running something at `localhost:3000`. For example, if you were running two documentation sites, they would be at `localhost:3000` and `localhost:3001`.
