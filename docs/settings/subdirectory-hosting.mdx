title: "Subdirectory Hosting"
---

Mintlify can be hosted in a `/docs` directory instead of a subdomain. For example: `your-site.com/docs` instead of `docs.your-site.com`.

To set up subdirectory hosting, you will need to move your DNS settings to Cloudflare and set up Cloudflare Workers. The instructions are complicated, but our team is here to help.
