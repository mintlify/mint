## Supported Analytics Providers

- Amplitude
- Fathom
- Google Analytics 4 (GA4)
- HotJar
- Mixpanel
- PostHog

When possible, we send custom documentation events in addition to the ones built-in to your analytics platform. For example, we send an event when a user opens or closes an [Accordion](../components/accordion).

## Enabling Analytics

Set your analytics keys in `mint.json`.

The syntax for `mint.json` is below. You only need to include entries for the platforms you want to connect.

<CodeGroup>

```json Analytics options in mint.json
"analytics": {
    "amplitude": {
        "apiKey": "required"
    },
    "fathom": {
        "siteId": "required"
    },
    "ga4": {
        "measurementId": "required"
    }
    "hotjar": {
        "hjid": "required",
        "hjsv": "required"
    },

    },
    "posthog": {
        "apiKey": "required",
        "apiHost": "optional"
    }
}
