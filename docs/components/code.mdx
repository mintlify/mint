## Basic

### Inline Code

To denote a `word` or `phrase` as code, enclose it in backticks (`).

```

```

### Code Block

Use [fenced code blocks](https://www.markdownguide.org/extended-syntax/#fenced-code-blocks) by enclosing code by three backticks and follow the leading ticks with the programming language of your snippet to get syntax highlighting.

Optionally follow the programming language with the name of the tab.

```java HelloWorld.java
class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, World!");
    }
}
```

````md
```java HelloWorld.java
class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, World!");
    }
}
```
````

### Syntax Highlighting

````md Add Syntax Highlighting by Writing the Language
```your-programming-language-goes-here

```
````

We use [Prism](https://prismjs.com/#supported-languages) for syntax highlighting. [Test Drive Prism](https://prismjs.com/test.html#language=markup) lists all the languages supported.

Code snippets without a language will use one color for everything.

## Advanced

### Code group

The `CodeGroup` component lets you create [code blocks](#code-block) in a display separated by tabs.

<Frame>

<CodeGroup>

```javascript helloWorld.js
console.log("Hello World");
```

```python hello_world.py
print('Hello World!')
```

```java HelloWorld.java
class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, World!");
    }
}
```

</CodeGroup>

</Frame>

````md
<CodeGroup>

```javascript helloWorld.js
console.log("Hello World");
```

```python hello_world.py
print('Hello World!')
```

```java HelloWorld.java
class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, World!");
    }
}
```

</CodeGroup>
````

### Importing from another file

If you want to show the same code snippet in multiple pages you can create it in a separate file and import it where you need it. Importing works for all MDX files, not just code blocks.

For example, you could make `code-snippet.mdx` with the following content:

````md code-snippet.mdx
```java HelloWorld.java
class HelloWorld { }
```
````

To import and use the snippet, you would write:

```md other-file.mdx
import CodeSnippet from "../../snippets/code-snippet.mdx";

Here is my code snippet:

<CodeSnippet />
```

Where `../../snippets/code-snippet.mdx` is the path to your code snippet.
