Components are reusable building blocks for your documentation. They can be added **directly within your files**. Some components are rendered from [Markdown syntax](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/), while other components work the same way as [React components](https://reactjs.org/docs/components-and-props.html).

## Examples

### Linking to Pages

You can add a link by wrapping it in `[]()`. You would write `[link to google](https://google.com)` to [link to google](https://google.com).

Links to pages in your docs need to include the entire folder path. For example, `[link to text](/components/text)` links to the page "Text" in our components section. Relative links like `[link to text](../text)` will open slower because we cannot optimize them as easily.

### Using a component

The following example is a [Code](/components/code) component, which lets you display syntax-highlighted code.

```java
class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, World!");
    }
}
```

It's rendered using the following code.

````md
```java
class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, World!");
    }
}
```
````

### Creating a callout

To present additional context outside of the main content, you can use a [Callout](/components/callout) component.

## Components

There are a variety of components from [Text](/components/text), [Table](/components/table), and tons others that you can explore in the `Components` section of the menu.
