## Setup

### Basic Configuration

Every Mintlify site needs a `mint.json` file with the core configuration settings added. You can learn more about the structure of the config file at the [customization guide](/settings/customization).

### Automatic Deployments

Once the files are ready for deployment, you can choose to host your docs from your source control provider. Follow one of the following guides to set up deployment.

## GitHub Setup Guide

### Open a Public Repo

Create a public repo where you would like to host the documentation.

<Tip>
  You can also use a private repo but it prevents users from suggesting changes
  and raising issues.
</Tip>

### Add Files

The onboarding team will provide a zip file with the contents of the documentation. Unzip the file and add the contents into a `/docs` directory of the repo.

The result should look something like this.

<img className="rounded" src="/img/docs-repo.png" />

### Install the GitHub Bot

Install the Mintlify GitHub Bot using request link provided by the onboarding team. Make sure it's granted access to the repo with the documentation.

Now, when you make changes to the docs and push them to the main branch, it will automatically deploy to your documentation page!

## GitLab Setup Guide

### API Authentication

Our endpoints use bearer token authentication. We will send you your token when you sign up with Mintlify. Please contact us if you need more tokens or need to delete one.

### Generate a GitLab access token

You can use a [Personal Access Tokens](https://gitlab.com/-/profile/personal_access_tokens) if you are on GitLab's free tier or a Project Access Token if you are on their paid tier.

The token needs `read_api` and `read_repository` permissions. We recommend setting an expiration at least one year in the future.

<img className="rounded" src="/img/token-permissions.png" />

### Get your Project ID from your project's home page

<img className="rounded" src="/img/project-id.png" />

### Send us your GitLab access token

Make a `PUT` request to `https://docs.mintlify.com/api/v1/sites/integrations/gitlab` with your bearer token in the header.

The body should be a JSON object of the form:

```json body
{
    accessToken: your gitlab access token,
    projectId: your project ID,
    deployBranch: "main" or "master" depending on your repository's default
}
```

You can always update your access token by making `PUT` requests to the endpoint. You can also verify you set it correctly by making a `GET` request. Lastly, you can delete your token with a `DELETE` request.

### Create a GitLab webhook

On your project page go to Settings > Webhooks. Enter `https://docs.mintlify.com/api/v1/sites/deploys/gitlab-listener` as the webhook URL. Enter your bearer token as the secret. Make the trigger run on push events to your deploy branch, likely "main" or "master" depending on your repository.
