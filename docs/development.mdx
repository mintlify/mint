## Installing

Download the Mintlify <Tooltip tip="Command-line Interface">CLI</Tooltip> using the following command.

```bash Terminal
npm i -g mintlify
```

## Previewing Docs Locally

Run the following command at the root of your documentation where `mint.json` is located. Mintlify will open at `localhost:3000`.

```bash Terminal
mintlify dev
```

<Tip>

The Mintlify CLI will automatically move to the next port if you were already running something at `localhost:3000`. For example, if you were running two documentation sites, they would be at `localhost:3000` and `localhost:3001`.

</Tip>

## Troubleshooting

Here's how to solve some common problems when working with the CLI.
