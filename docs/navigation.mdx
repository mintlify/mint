## Navigation syntax

Our navigation syntax is recursive letting you make nested navigation groups. You don't need to include `.mdx` in page names.

<CodeGroup>

```json Regular Navigation
"navigation": [
    {
        "group": "Getting Started",
        "pages": ["quickstart"]
    }
]
```

```json Nested Navigation
"navigation": [
    {
        "group": "Design Principles",
        "pages": [
            "overview",
            {
                "group": "Nested Reference Pages",
                "pages": ["nested-page-name"]
            }
        ]
    }
]
```

</CodeGroup>

## Folders

Simply put your `.mdx` files in folders and update the paths in `mint.json`.

For example, `https://yoursite.com/my-folder/my-page` requires you to have a folder called `my-folder` containing an mdx file called `my-page.mdx`.

<Warning>

You cannot use `api` for the name of a folder unless you nest it inside another folder. Mintlify uses Next.js which reserves the `api` folder for internal server calls.

Good: `other-folder/api/page-name`

Bad: `api/other-folder/page-name`

</Warning>

```json Navigation With Folder
"navigation": [
    {
        "group": "Group Name",
        "pages": ["my-folder/my-page"]
    }
]
```

## Hidden Pages

Mdx files you don't include in `mint.json` will still show up on your website. Hidden pages never show up in the sidebar navigation but can be found through the search bar.
