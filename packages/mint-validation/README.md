# mint-validation

`mint-validation` is a small package to validate `mint.json` files.

# Installation

`npm install mint-validation`

# Usage

```
import { validateMintConfig } from "mint-validation"

const configObject = { name: "Site Name", navigation: [] }

validateMintConfig(configObject)
```

This package assumes you have already loaded a config object into a JavaScript object.

## Return Values

The package returns an object with the properties `status`, `warnings`, and `errors`.

`status` can be one of: `"success"`, `"error"`.

`warnings` is a string array with warnings the user should know but are not expected to break the site.

`errors` is a string array of errors that will likely break the site.

When `status === "error"` you should stop trying to build `mint`, your `mint.json` file is invalid and will the site will crash when building.

## Return Value Example

```
{
    "status": "error",
    "warnings": ["Navigation is an empty array, no pages will be shown"],
    "errors": ["Mintlify does not support .ico favicons, use .svg or .png instead."]
}
```
